# Discord Promo Code Redeemer

## Project Overview
- Develop a Discord promo code redeemer tool in Python to automate the process of redeeming promotional codes on Discord.
- The tool will allow users to input promo codes and automatically redeem them on Discord servers.

## Features
- Ability to input promo codes to be redeemed.
- Automatically redeem promo codes on specified Discord servers.
- Notify users of successful code redemption.
- Display error messages for failed redemption attempts.
- Option to redeem multiple codes sequentially.
- Log successful and failed redemption attempts for future reference.

## Enhancements
- Implement a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Add a feature to import a list of promo codes from a file.
- Include a verification step to ensure the codes are valid before redemption.
- Integrate a scheduling feature to redeem codes at specified times.
- Enhance error handling to provide more detailed error messages for troubleshooting.

## Programming Language
- Python will be used due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support.

## APIs
- Discord API: To interact with Discord servers, manage messages, and redeem promo codes.

## Packages and Libraries
- discord.py (latest version): To facilitate communication with Discord using Python.
- PyQt5 (latest version): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the promo code redeemer tool.
- requests (latest version): To handle HTTP requests for code redemption and validation.
- datetime (built-in): For handling date and time operations.
- logging (built-in): To log successful and failed redemption attempts for auditing purposes.

## Rationale
- Python was chosen for its ease of use and wide community support.
- discord.py is the official Discord API wrapper for Python, ensuring compatibility and reliability.
- PyQt5 provides a robust framework for creating a user-friendly GUI.
- requests simplifies handling HTTP requests, crucial for interacting with Discord servers.
- datetime is essential for scheduling code redemption at specific times.
- logging allows for easy tracking of redemption attempts for troubleshooting and auditing.

## Conclusion
- By utilizing Python with discord.py and integrating PyQt5 for GUI, along with requests and datetime for functionality, the Discord promo code redeemer tool will offer a seamless user experience for automating code redemption efficiently.
